# Simple REST API built w/ mux

A RESTful API developed in Golang via the mux framework; the premise of the API is a simple terminal blog with the posts stored in a composite literal storing structs (Posts) that can be accessed via the GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE methods.

This mini project is for personal reference intended to serve as an introduction to mux. The natural way to progress is onto a project that  incorporates a connection to a DB instance.
